    "`Broadcasting` in NumPy is a powerful feature that allows operations to be performed on arrays of different shapes. It does this by automatically expanding the smaller array along the larger array's dimensions:\n",
    "- Starting with the trailing dimensions: The broadcasting operation starts by comparing the shapes of the two arrays from the end (trailing dimensions) towards the front.\n",
    "- Compatibility Check: Two dimensions are compatible for broadcasting if:\n",
    "    - they are equal, or\n",
    "    - one of them is 1.\n",
    "- Stretching the smaller dimension: If one of the arrays has a smaller dimension, NumPy will 'broadcast' the smaller array across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting a dimension of size 1 means replicating the values along that dimension.\n",
    "- No new data is created: It's important to note that broadcasting does not actually duplicate the smaller array; instead, it virtually replicates the array in memory during the operation.\n",
    "- Performing the operation: Once the arrays have been virtually expanded to have compatible shapes, the element-wise operation is performed."
