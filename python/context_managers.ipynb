    "`Context managers` in Python are used to properly manage resources so that they are set up and released appropriately. They are commonly used with the with statement. The main purpose is to ensure that set-up and tear-down code is executed reliably, even if the block of code exits unexpectedly (due to exceptions, for instance).\n",

    "A context manager controls the entry and exit from the block of code. It typically implements two special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "__enter__: This method sets up the context and is called when execution enters the context of the with statement. It can return an object that is bound to the variable after the as keyword in the with statement (if there is one).\n",
    "__exit__: This method handles the tear-down and is called when execution leaves the context. This could be because the code block finished executing, or because an exception was raised. It can suppress exceptions if it returns True."
