    "Here are two examples where you would use the `query` method instead of `merge` in Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filtering DataFrames:\n",
    "   Suppose you have two DataFrames, `df1` and `df2`, and you want to filter `df1` based on a condition involving a column from `df2`. In this case, you can use the `query` method to filter `df1` without the need for a merge operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Example 1: Using query for filtering\n",
    "   filtered_df = df1.query('column1 > @df2[\"column2\"].mean()')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `query` method allows you to directly reference the column from `df2` within the condition. This is useful when you want to filter `df1` based on an aggregate value, such as the mean of a column in `df2`, without the need for merging the two DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Complex Conditions:\n",
    "   Sometimes you may have a complex condition involving multiple columns that you want to use to filter a DataFrame. In such cases, the `query` method provides a cleaner and more readable way to express the condition compared to using multiple merge operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Example 2: Using query for complex condition\n",
    "   filtered_df = df.query('(column1 > 5) and (column2 == \"value\") and (column3 < 10)')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the `query` method allows you to express a complex condition involving three columns (`column1`, `column2`, and `column3`) in a single statement. This results in more concise and readable code compared to using multiple merge operations or chained boolean indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both examples, the `query` method is used to filter a DataFrame based on a condition, without the need for merging multiple DataFrames. This showcases how the `query` method can be a useful tool for filtering and extracting data based on specific criteria, particularly when dealing with complex conditions or aggregate values from other DataFrames."

    "While the `df.query()` method in Pandas provides a convenient way to filter DataFrames based on a specified condition, there are a few downsides to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Limited Expressiveness:\n",
    "   The syntax used in `df.query()` is slightly different from standard Python syntax, which can limit the expressiveness of the condition you can specify. Some Python constructs, such as complex function calls or certain operators, may not be directly compatible with the `query()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String Parsing Overhead:\n",
    "   The `df.query()` method internally parses the provided string condition to evaluate the expression. This parsing step adds some overhead, especially when dealing with large DataFrames or frequently applied filters. In certain cases, this overhead may impact the performance of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable Referencing Limitations:\n",
    "   While the `query()` method allows referencing variables from the local environment using the `@` symbol, it does not support all possible variable references. Complex expressions or references involving nested data structures might not work as expected within the `query()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging Complexity:\n",
    "   When using the `query()` method, debugging can be more challenging compared to traditional boolean indexing or conditional statements. If you encounter an error or need to investigate the filtering process, it can be harder to pinpoint and troubleshoot issues within the string-based query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Learning Curve:\n",
    "   Although the `query()` method can be useful, it requires learning a specific syntax and understanding its limitations. If you are working collaboratively or maintaining code for others, it's important to consider the learning curve for team members who may not be familiar with this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these downsides, the `query()` method can still be valuable for many filtering scenarios, particularly for simpler conditions and when code readability is a priority. However, it's important to be aware of its limitations and evaluate whether it aligns with your specific use case and performance requirements."
